# Blinkit-Data-Analyzing
This project analyzes Blinkit data by performing necessary preprocessing and data normalization to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis. After cleaning and preparing the dataset, sales trends, and delivery performance were standardized for meaningful comparisons. A Power BI dashboard was then developed to monitor and visualize this data.
